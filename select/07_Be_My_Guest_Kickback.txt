You're always trying to put me down*
Saying your shit when I'm not there
When I'm around you shake my hand
Stop being a shit and fight with me

BE MY GUEST

Now it's enough you cross my path
What you've done comes back to you
Now it's enough you cross my path
I'll take you down in my attack

BE MY GUEST

Move it!
You can keep my friend
Watch you back!
I fuck you up
Punishment
